            <header>Services We Offer</header>

                <paragraph>We also undertake proactive tax planning for every client - as standard.  You can be sure that your business and personal tax affairs have been carefully reviewed and any options for improvement explored and explained. We aim to minimise all clients tax liabilities and ensure clients understand what they need to pay and when.  No surprise tax bills!</paragraph>
                <paragraph>If you're just starting out we can advise on the correct format of the business and if appropriate form you a limited company for a modest fee.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>As Registered Auditors we can undertake any assurance engagements our larger clients may require.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>If you would prefer to prepare your bookkeeping yourself we can recommend the right software for you, to use and be there to support you using it throughout the year.

            <header>Our Fees</header>
            <content>
                <intro>Our fees are competitive and based on the time 'actually' spent on your affairs. We prefer not to offer 'standard fixed fees' as we don't think you should pay for any service you don't necessarily need.</intro>
                <paragraph>We think you, your business and your personal tax affairs are unique. When you engage us as your accountants we want to understand your individual requirements and we will estimate our fee according to the various services you choose to use.  We also offer a monthly standing order facility for you to pay towards our fees and we also accept all major debit and credit cards.</paragraph>

            <content>
                <intro>We are always interested in talking to new clients.

Also we are one of the Country's leading advisors to online traders using eBay, Amazon etc - we have even published our own guide with specific advice for such businesses which is available for free.</paragraph>
